Coded with cartridge glitches, corroded guitar melodies and escapist fantasies of true love and teenage apathy amongst the crumbling edifices of a dying planet. It was written and demoed in a bedroom a hundred feet from the site of the final Joy Division gig and later self-produced at a remote location in Birmingham, England, pieced together from pitch-shifted guitar samples and snatches of W.H. Auden poetry. Taking inspiration from post-punk brutalism and saccharine 60s pop, ‘Joie de Vivre’ is a song about happiness and apocalypse."},{"Text":"Released in September, the track is already making a splash amongst those to have heard it, with BBC Introducing West Midlands naming it their \'Track of the Month\' for September and giving it its radio premiere last weekend. \'Joie de Vivre\' was hailed by Alex Noble, head of BBC Introducing WM, as having \'a real timeless feel while being very 2019 in the process,\' calling Shai Brides \'a great new experimental band to add to so many in this scene.\'"}]')}}]);
