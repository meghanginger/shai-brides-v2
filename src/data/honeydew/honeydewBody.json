  "Honeydew is a song about doubts and nervous love. Itâ€™s about new feelings and old insecurities, being eager to accelerate but hesitant to lose control. We wanted to create something that was just as warm and summery as it is cold and autumnal; a veneer of vintage pop pleasantness masking a melancholy depth."
