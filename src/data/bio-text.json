        "Text": "Their debut single, ‘Joie de Vivre’, is the theme to a post-apocalyptic video game. Coded with cartridge glitches, corroded guitar melodies and escapist fantasies of true love and teenage apathy amongst the crumbling edifices of a dying planet. The track was named BBC Introducing West Midlands' Track of the Month for September 2019, with Alex Noble labelling 'Joie de Vivre' \"an exception... one of the strongest debuts I've heard in my time on this programme.\""

        "Text": "The band's second single, 'Tokyo Drift', was released on 6th March 2020 and is a bratty synth-punk futurescape about relationship strain amongst mass destruction, inspired by CD-ROM games and hectic neon chase scenes. The mysterious love of ‘Joie de Vivre’ has gone sour and in its place are lingering doubts, a blistering drum loop and strobe-lit landscapes awash with cold synth glitches and dark skyscrapers. Although written within a week of the band's debut single ‘Joie de Vivre’, in the same university bedroom, ‘Tokyo Drift’ marks a bitter change in tone: an eerie staple of what is to come."
